            <p>Crimes against women have more than doubled over the past ten years, according to latest.</p>

            <p>As many as 2.24 million crimes against women were reported over the past decade: 26 crimes against women are reported every hour, or one complaint every two minutes, reveals an IndiaSpend analysis based on the last decade&#39;s data.</p>

            <p>The semantic meaning of &#34;crime against women&#34; is direct or indirect physical or mental cruelty to women. Crimes directed specifically against women and in which only women are victims are characterised as &#34;crimes against women&#34;.</p>
